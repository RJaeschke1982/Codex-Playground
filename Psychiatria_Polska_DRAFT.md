**Para 1.** # Sleep Disturbances in Adults with ADHD: Underlying Mechanisms, Clinical Consequences, and Evidence-Based Therapeutic Approaches

**Para 2.** Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, with a worldwide point prevalence estimated between 1.5% and 5% (Ayano et al., 2023). Yet, the DSM-5 definition, with its emphasis on hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention, might inadvertently invert the causal relationship. It risks portraying these behaviors as the defining characteristics of ADHD, rather than acknowledging them as downstream consequences of underlying neurocognitive dysfunction (Bozhilova et al., 2018; Christoff et al., 2016; Vatansever, Menon and Stamatakis, 2019). Beyond these cardinal symptoms, individuals with ADHD frequently grapple with significant sleep disturbances, a dimension often overlooked, yet one that profoundly impacts cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functioning (Wynchank et al., 2017; van der Ham et al., 2024).

**Para 3.** The intricate connection between sleep disturbances and ADHD has been substantiated in numerous studies (Wynchank et al., 2017; Migueis et al., 2023; van der Ham et al., 2024). These disturbances span a spectrum of conditions, including insomnia (manifesting as difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, and compromised sleep quality), Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS, characterized by a shift in the circadian rhythm to later nighttime hours), Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS, marked by unpleasant sensations in the limbs that intensify in the evening), disruptions in REM and Slow-Wave Sleep (SWS) architecture (thereby affecting the body's restorative processes), sleep-related breathing disorders, hypersomnia (excessive sleepiness), and parasomnias. A recent cross-sectional study encompassing 3691 adults with ADHD revealed that a striking 6 out of 10 patients experienced at least one sleep disorder, and over one-third grappled with two or more (van der Ham et al., 2024). It is noteworthy that almost half of the participants in this study also presented with comorbid psychiatric disorders, a factor that further complicates the intricate interplay, as many of these comorbidities are themselves intertwined with sleep disturbances (van der Ham et al., 2024).

**Para 4.** The question of causality, however, remains a critical area of inquiry. Indeed, circadian dysregulation is increasingly recognized not merely as a comorbid condition, but potentially as an intrinsic feature of ADHD (Bijlenga et al., 2019). Some experts have proposed that ADHD might partly be conceptualized as a disorder of chronobiology – a “24/7” condition that affects the sleep-wake cycle (Coogan et al., 2016). To what extent, then, might ADHD be understood as a complex sleep disorder, with circadian rhythm dysregulation and dopaminergic/noradrenergic pathway disruptions serving as core components of its pathogenesis? A growing body of scientific evidence suggests a relationship between ADHD and circadian rhythm disturbances that transcends simple comorbidity, potentially involving shared neurobiological underpinnings (Kooij and Bijlenga, 2013; Mehta et al., 2019; Bijlenga et al., 2019; Hvolby, 2015; Snitselaar et al., 2017).

**Para 5.** The disruption of circadian rhythms can exacerbate ADHD symptoms, while also generating difficulties that mimic the disorder's core features (Weiss et al., 2015; Pérez-Carbonell et al., 2022). Historically, ADHD and sleep disorders were evaluated separately; however, emerging evidence now supports a complex bidirectional relationship whereby ADHD symptoms can disrupt sleep, and sleep disturbances can exacerbate core ADHD symptoms (Wajszilber et al., 2018). This reciprocal relationship, where sleep problems both arise from and contribute to ADHD pathology, significantly complicates both diagnosis and the pursuit of effective treatment (Kooij and Bijlenga, 2013). Delving into this complex interplay is of paramount importance, particularly in light of emerging evidence indicating that ADHD may be associated with a reduced life expectancy – a risk potentially linked to modifiable factors, including sleep disturbances, and the degree to which therapeutic interventions are tailored to address both ADHD and co-occurring conditions (O’Nions et al., 2025).

**Para 6.** Further intricacies arise from the observation that the prevalence and specific manifestations of sleep disturbances in ADHD appear to be modulated by both sex and the presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders (van der Ham et al., 2024). Sleep disorders were demonstrably more common in patients with co-occurring psychiatric conditions, a correlation that held true regardless of gender (van der Ham et al., 2024). Women with ADHD were more prone to experiencing sleep disturbances in general, and specifically exhibited higher rates of insomnia, excessive sleepiness, and parasomnias, whereas men were more likely to be diagnosed with sleep-related breathing disorders (van der Ham et al., 2024). These gender-related disparities persisted irrespective of the presence or absence of comorbid psychiatric conditions (van der Ham et al., 2024).

- Literature Search Strategy This narrative review is based on a structured literature search designed to identify relevant studies on sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances in adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder .
- The core search query included terms such as: ("adult ADHD" OR "attention deficit hyperactivity disorder") AND ("circadian rhythms" OR "sleep disorders" OR "insomnia" OR "delayed sleep phase syndrome" OR "chronobiology").
- This primary query was supplemented with more specific searches using terms related to interventions, including ("melatonin" OR "light therapy" OR "phototherapy" OR "chronotherapy" OR "CBT-I" OR "coaching").
- Inclusion criteria for articles were: (1) focus on an adult population (18+ years) with a diagnosis of ADHD; (2) investigation of sleep disorders, circadian rhythms, or related treatments; (3) published in the English language.
- The Interplay Between ADHD and Sleep Disturbances ### 3.1.
- Circadian Dysregulation: A Core Feature of ADHD, or a Consequence?
- The relationship between ADHD and sleep disturbances extends beyond simple comorbidity.
- A growing body of evidence suggests that circadian dysregulation may be an intrinsic feature of ADHD (Bijlenga et al., 2019).
- This raises a fundamental question: To what extent is ADHD a complex sleep disorder, with circadian rhythm dysregulation, potentially driven by disruptions in dopaminergic and noradrenergic pathways, serving as a core component of its pathogenesis?
- Studies have consistently shown that adults with ADHD exhibit a higher prevalence of Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD) compared to the general population (van Veen et al., 2010; Bijlenga et al., 2013).
- Clinically, many adults with ADHD identify as “evening types,” and objective measurements, such as dim light melatonin onset (DLMO), often reveal a significantly delayed circadian phase in individuals with ADHD (van Veen et al., 2010; Coogan et al., 2016).
- Controlled studies report that the mean DLMO in ADHD patients occurs approximately 1.5 hours later than in control groups, thereby supporting the hypothesis that circadian misalignment contributes to the pathophysiology of ADHD.
- This delay in melatonin secretion, a key hormone regulating the sleep-wake cycle, contributes to difficulties falling asleep at conventional bedtimes and waking up in the morning (Kooij & Bijlenga, 2013).
- Shifted cortisol rhythms have also been observed in adults with ADHD, further supporting the presence of circadian dysregulation (Coogan et al., 2016).
- The underlying mechanisms linking circadian dysregulation and ADHD are likely multifaceted, involving shared neurobiological pathways (Hvolby, 2015).
- Dopamine and norepinephrine, neurotransmitters crucial for attention, arousal, and executive function, are also implicated in regulating the sleep-wake cycle (Mehta et al., 2019; Bijlenga et al., 2019).
- Dysregulation in these neurotransmitter systems, a hallmark of ADHD, could therefore contribute to both the core symptoms of ADHD and the observed circadian rhythm disturbances (Valsecchi et al., 2022).
- Furthermore, genetic factors, such as polymorphisms in circadian clock genes like CLOCK and PER3, may predispose individuals to both ADHD and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (Arns et al., 2013). ### 3.2.
- The Role of External Factors Several external factors can exacerbate sleep difficulties and circadian rhythm disruption in individuals with ADHD.
- Blue light suppresses melatonin production, further delaying the circadian phase and making it more difficult to fall asleep (Allada & Bass, 2021).
- Individuals with ADHD may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of evening light exposure due to pre-existing circadian dysregulation.
- Poor sleep hygiene, characterized by inconsistent sleep-wake schedules, consumption of caffeine or alcohol close to bedtime, and engaging in stimulating activities before sleep, can also contribute to sleep problems in individuals with ADHD.
- These external factors not only exacerbate underlying circadian issues but also create a self-reinforcing cycle of sleep disruption and daytime dysfunction. ### 3.3.
- The Bidirectional Relationship Between ADHD and Sleep Disturbances, and its Clinical Implications The relationship between ADHD and sleep disturbances is increasingly understood as bidirectional.
- Symptoms inherent to ADHD (such as procrastination, hyperfocus, and poor self-regulation) may lead to delayed bedtimes, while inadequate sleep in turn intensifies inattention and impulsivity.
- Sleep problems, including circadian dysregulation, can exacerbate core ADHD symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity (Weiss et al., 2015; Pérez-Carbonell et al., 2022).
- Conversely, ADHD symptoms, particularly hyperactivity and impulsivity, can make it more difficult to establish and maintain healthy sleep habits (Wynchank et al., 2017; Kooij et al., 2019).
- Experimental evidence suggests that even a single night of poor-quality sleep can markedly impair cognitive performance in individuals with ADHD, thereby reinforcing a vicious cycle of symptom exacerbation (Wajszilber et al., 2018).
- This creates a self-perpetuating cycle, where sleep deficits worsen ADHD symptoms, which, in turn, further disrupt sleep.
- The presence of sleep disturbances in adults with ADHD is associated with a greater risk of various adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and mood disorders (Medic, Wille & Hemels, 2017; van Andel et al., 2024; Gottesman et al., 2024; Keramat et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2017).
- Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests a potential association between ADHD and reduced life expectancy, a risk that may be partly mediated by modifiable factors, including sleep disturbances (O’Nions et al., 2025).
- It is important to note that ADHD rarely occurs in isolation.
- Studies suggest that 60–80% of adults with ADHD have at least one additional psychiatric comorbidity, such as depression or anxiety, which independently contribute to sleep disruption.
- ADHD as a Complex Sleep Disorder: A Critical Evaluation The high prevalence of sleep disturbances in individuals with ADHD, coupled with the evidence of shared neurobiological pathways and the bidirectional relationship between ADHD symptoms and sleep problems, has led some researchers to propose that ADHD, at least in a subset of cases, might be more accurately characterized as a complex sleep disorder (Bijlenga et al., 2019; Kooij & Bijlenga, 2013).
- This perspective challenges the traditional view of ADHD as primarily a neurodevelopmental disorder of attention and executive function. ### 4.1.
- The Case for ADHD as a “Circadian” Disorder (Supporting Evidence) * **High Prevalence of Sleep Disturbances:** As previously discussed, a significant majority of adults with ADHD experience clinically significant sleep problems, most notably Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD) and insomnia (van der Ham et al., 2024; Wynchank et al., 2017; Wajszilber et al., 2018).
- Many adults with ADHD meet the diagnostic criteria for DSWPD (van der Ham et al., 2024). * **Circadian Dysregulation as a Core Feature:** The consistent finding of delayed circadian rhythms, as evidenced by delayed dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and actigraphy data, suggests that circadian dysregulation is not merely a comorbidity but a potentially intrinsic feature of ADHD (Bijlenga et al., 2013; Coogan et al., 2016; Snitselaar et al., 2017). * **Shared Neurobiological Mechanisms:** The overlap in neurobiological pathways involved in ADHD and sleep regulation, particularly the dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and adenosinergic systems, provides a plausible mechanism by which sleep disruption could directly contribute to ADHD symptoms (Bijlenga et al., 2019; Mehta et al., 2019; Volkow et al., 2012). * **Symptom Overlap:** Many of the cognitive and behavioral consequences of chronic sleep deprivation, such as inattention, impulsivity, and emotional dysregulation, closely resemble the core symptoms of ADHD (Pérez-Carbonell et al., 2022; Weiss et al., 2015; Wajszilber et al., 2018).
