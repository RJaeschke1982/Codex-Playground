1. Introduction

   

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, with a worldwide point prevalence estimated between 1.5% and 5% (Ayano et al., 2023). Yet, the DSM-5 definition, with its emphasis on hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention, might inadvertently invert the causal relationship. It risks portraying these behaviors as the defining characteristics of ADHD, rather than acknowledging them as downstream consequences of underlying neurocognitive dysfunction (Bozhilova et al., 2018; Christoff et al., 2016; Vatansever, Menon and Stamatakis, 2019).

Beyond these cardinal symptoms, individuals with ADHD frequently grapple with significant sleep disturbances, a dimension often overlooked, yet one that profoundly impacts cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functioning (Wynchank et al., 2017; van der Ham et al., 2024). The intricate connection between sleep disturbances and ADHD has been substantiated in numerous studies (Wynchank et al., 2017; Migueis et al., 2023; van der Ham et al., 2024). These disturbances span a spectrum of conditions, including insomnia (manifesting as difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, and compromised sleep quality), Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS, characterized by a shift in the circadian rhythm to later nighttime hours), Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS, marked by unpleasant sensations in the limbs that intensify in the evening), disruptions in REM and Slow-Wave Sleep (SWS) architecture (thereby affecting the body's restorative processes), sleep-related breathing disorders, hypersomnia (excessive sleepiness), and parasomnias. A recent cross-sectional study encompassing 3691 adults with ADHD revealed that a striking 6 out of 10 patients experienced at least one sleep disorder, and over one-third grappled with two or more (van der Ham et al., 2024). It is noteworthy that almost half of the participants in this study also presented with comorbid psychiatric disorders, a factor that further complicates the intricate interplay, as many of these comorbidities are themselves intertwined with sleep disturbances (van der Ham et al., 2024).

The question of causality, however, remains a critical area of inquiry. Indeed, circadian dysregulation is increasingly recognized not merely as a comorbid condition, but potentially as an intrinsic feature of ADHD (Bijlenga et al., 2019). Some experts have proposed that ADHD might partly be conceptualized as a disorder of chronobiology – a “24/7” condition that affects the sleep-wake cycle (Coogan et al., 2016). To what extent, then, might ADHD be understood as a complex sleep disorder, with circadian rhythm dysregulation and dopaminergic/noradrenergic pathway disruptions serving as core components of its pathogenesis? A growing body of scientific evidence suggests a relationship between ADHD and circadian rhythm disturbances that transcends simple comorbidity, potentially involving shared neurobiological underpinnings (Kooij and Bijlenga, 2013; Mehta et al., 2019; Bijlenga et al., 2019; Hvolby, 2015; Snitselaar et al., 2017). The disruption of circadian rhythms can exacerbate ADHD symptoms, while also generating difficulties that mimic the disorder's core features (Weiss et al., 2015; Pérez-Carbonell et al., 2022). Historically, ADHD and sleep disorders were evaluated separately; however, emerging evidence now supports a complex bidirectional relationship whereby ADHD symptoms can disrupt sleep, and sleep disturbances can exacerbate core ADHD symptoms (Wajszilber et al., 2018). This reciprocal relationship, where sleep problems both arise from and contribute to ADHD pathology, significantly complicates both diagnosis and the pursuit of effective treatment (Kooij and Bijlenga, 2013). Delving into this complex interplay is of paramount importance, particularly in light of emerging evidence indicating that ADHD may be associated with a reduced life expectancy – a risk potentially linked to modifiable factors, including sleep disturbances, and the degree to which therapeutic interventions are tailored to address both ADHD and co-occurring conditions (O’Nions et al., 2025).

Further intricacies arise from the observation that the prevalence and specific manifestations of sleep disturbances in ADHD appear to be modulated by both sex and the presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders (van der Ham et al., 2024). Sleep disorders were demonstrably more common in patients with co-occurring psychiatric conditions, a correlation that held true regardless of gender (van der Ham et al., 2024). Women with ADHD were more prone to experiencing sleep disturbances in general, and specifically exhibited higher rates of insomnia, excessive sleepiness, and parasomnias, whereas men were more likely to be diagnosed with sleep-related breathing disorders (van der Ham et al., 2024). These gender-related disparities persisted irrespective of the presence or absence of comorbid psychiatric conditions (van der Ham et al., 2024).

Sleep disturbances, moreover, demonstrably exacerbate ADHD symptoms, establishing a bidirectional, self-perpetuating cycle (Wynchank et al., 2017; Kooij et al., 2019). The ramifications extend far beyond the cognitive and psychiatric realms (Medic, Wille and Hemels, 2017), encompassing an elevated risk of severe medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease (van Andel et al., 2024; Gottesman et al., 2024), metabolic syndrome, obesity (Keramat et al., 2023), type 2 diabetes (Lin et al., 2017), and hypertension (Medic, Wille and Hemels, 2017). Moreover, disrupted sleep has been correlated with cognitive decline, an increased risk of dementia (Gottesman et al., 2024), chronic pain, and mood disorders such as depression (Medic, Wille and Hemels, 2017).

Given this multifaceted and complex landscape, this article aims to synthesize the most current scientific evidence concerning the relationship between ADHD and sleep disturbances. This interplay necessitates a comprehensive, evidence-based approach to patient management in order to optimize both daytime functioning and overall quality of life (Wajszilber et al., 2018).

### **2\. Methods**

**2.1. Literature Search Strategy**

This narrative review is based on a structured literature search designed to identify relevant studies on sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances in adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ~~(ADHD)~~. The search was conducted using the PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar databases, covering publications up to and including the first quarter of 2025\.

The search strategy employed a combination of MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms and free-text keywords. The core search query included terms such as: `("adult ADHD" OR "attention deficit hyperactivity disorder") AND ("circadian rhythms" OR "sleep disorders" OR "insomnia" OR "delayed sleep phase syndrome" OR "chronobiology")`. This primary query was supplemented with more specific searches using terms related to interventions, including `("melatonin" OR "light therapy" OR "phototherapy" OR "chronotherapy" OR "CBT-I" OR "coaching")`.

Inclusion criteria for articles were: (1) focus on an adult population (18+ years) with a diagnosis of ADHD; (2) investigation of sleep disorders, circadian rhythms, or related treatments; (3) published in the English language. Exclusion criteria were: (1) primary focus on pediatric or adolescent populations; (2) articles not available in full-text format. The reference lists of key review articles and consensus statements were also manually screened to identify additional relevant publications.

**2.2. Data-Driven Thematic Analysis**

To supplement the narrative synthesis and identify latent themes within the collected literature in an objective, bottom-up manner, a computational thematic analysis was performed. This process consisted of several stages:

1. **Corpus Preparation:** A digital corpus was created from the full text of all selected publications (n=354). The text from each document was programmatically extracted for analysis.  
2. **Text Pre-processing:** The extracted text underwent a standardized pre-processing pipeline to ensure data quality and consistency. This included: conversion to lowercase, removal of all numerical digits, punctuation, and filtering of common English "stop words" (e.g., "the", "and", "is"). A custom list of academic-specific stop words (e.g., "et al", "doi", "figure", "abstract", "introduction") was also applied. Finally, all remaining words were reduced to their base dictionary form through lemmatization to group related terms (e.g., "studies", "studying" were converted to "study").  
3. **Topic Modeling:** A dynamic, density-based topic modeling approach was utilized to identify thematic clusters within the pre-processed corpus. This involved two key steps:  
   * First, the cleaned text of each document was transformed into a high-dimensional numerical vector (embedding) using a pre-trained language model (SciBERT), which is specifically optimized for scientific and biomedical text. This ensures that the semantic context of the documents is captured.  
   * Second, a density-based clustering algorithm (HDBSCAN) was applied to these document embeddings, following a dimensionality reduction step (UMAP). This method groups semantically similar documents into coherent topics without requiring pre-defined categories, thus reducing researcher bias.  
4. **Topic Representation:** Each discovered topic was automatically labeled and represented by a set of its most relevant keywords. These keywords were identified using a class-based TF-IDF (c-TF-IDF) algorithm, which scores words based on their importance to a topic relative to all other topics.

This unsupervised methodology was employed to provide an objective, data-driven map of the primary themes present in the existing literature, which subsequently informed the structure and focus of this narrative review.

**2.3. Data Synthesis and Effect Size Estimation**

For continuous outcomes (e.g., ADHD-RS scores), when dichotomous responder data were unavailable, the number needed to treat (NNT) was approximated using the method described by Furukawa and Leucht, based on the standardized mean difference (Cohen’s d). NNT was derived from d using the following transformation: NNT \= 1 / \[Φ(d / √2) − 0.5\] where Φ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. This method allows for a clinically interpretable estimate of the effect size from studies reporting continuous data.

**2.2. Circadian Dysregulation: A Core Feature of ADHD, or a Consequence?**

The relationship between ADHD and sleep d isturbances extends beyond simple comorbidity. A growing body of evidence suggests that circadian dysregulation may be an intrinsic feature of ADHD (Bijlenga et al., 2019). This raises a fundamental question: To what extent is ADHD a complex sleep disorder, with circadian rhythm dysregulation, potentially driven by disruptions in dopaminergic and noradrenergic pathways, serving as a core component of its pathogenesis? Studies have consistently shown that adults with ADHD exhibit a higher prevalence of Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD) compared to the general population (van Veen et al., 2010; Bijlenga et al., 2013). Clinically, many adults with ADHD identify as “evening types,” and objective measurements, such as dim light melatonin onset (DLMO), often reveal a significantly delayed circadian phase in individuals with ADHD (van Veen et al., 2010; Coogan et al., 2016). Controlled studies report that the mean DLMO in ADHD patients occurs approximately 1.5 hours later than in control groups, thereby supporting the hypothesis that circadian misalignment contributes to the pathophysiology of ADHD. This delay in melatonin secretion, a key hormone regulating the sleep-wake cycle, contributes to difficulties falling asleep at conventional bedtimes and waking up in the morning (Kooij & Bijlenga, 2013). Shifted cortisol rhythms have also been observed in adults with ADHD, further supporting the presence of circadian dysregulation (Coogan et al., 2016). The underlying mechanisms linking circadian dysregulation and ADHD are likely multifaceted, involving shared neurobiological pathways (Hvolby, 2015). Dopamine and norepinephrine, neurotransmitters crucial for attention, arousal, and executive function, are also implicated in regulating the sleep-wake cycle (Mehta et al., 2019; Bijlenga et al., 2019). Dysregulation in these neurotransmitter systems, a hallmark of ADHD, could therefore contribute to both the core symptoms of ADHD and the observed circadian rhythm disturbances (Valsecchi et al., 2022). Furthermore, genetic factors, such as polymorphisms in circadian clock genes like *CLOCK* and *PER3*, may predispose individuals to both ADHD and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (Arns et al., 2013).

2.3. The Role of External Factors

Several external factors can exacerbate sleep difficulties and circadian rhythm disruption in individuals with ADHD. One prominent factor is exposure to artificial light, particularly blue light emitted from electronic devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, computers) in the evening (Allada & Bass, 2021; Meyer et al., 2022). Blue light suppresses melatonin production, further delaying the circadian phase and making it more difficult to fall asleep (Allada & Bass, 2021). Individuals with ADHD may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of evening light exposure due to pre-existing circadian dysregulation. Poor sleep hygiene, characterized by inconsistent sleep-wake schedules, consumption of caffeine or alcohol close to bedtime, and engaging in stimulating activities before sleep, can also contribute to sleep problems in individuals with ADHD. Irregular daily schedules are also a significant contributor (Surman and Walsh, 2021). These external factors not only exacerbate underlying circadian issues but also create a self-reinforcing cycle of sleep disruption and daytime dysfunction.

2.4. The Bidirectional Relationship Between ADHD and Sleep Disturbances, and its Clinical Implications

The relationship between ADHD and sleep disturbances is increasingly understood as bidirectional. Symptoms inherent to ADHD (such as procrastination, hyperfocus, and poor self-regulation) may lead to delayed bedtimes, while inadequate sleep in turn intensifies inattention and impulsivity. Sleep problems, including circadian dysregulation, can exacerbate core ADHD symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity (Weiss et al., 2015; Pérez-Carbonell et al., 2022). Conversely, ADHD symptoms, particularly hyperactivity and impulsivity, can make it more difficult to establish and maintain healthy sleep habits (Wynchank et al., 2017; Kooij et al., 2019). Experimental evidence suggests that even a single night of poor-quality sleep can markedly impair cognitive performance in individuals with ADHD, thereby reinforcing a vicious cycle of symptom exacerbation (Wajszilber et al., 2018). This creates a self-perpetuating cycle, where sleep deficits worsen ADHD symptoms, which, in turn, further disrupt sleep. This complex interplay has significant clinical implications. The presence of sleep disturbances in adults with ADHD is associated with a greater risk of various adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and mood disorders (Medic, Wille & Hemels, 2017; van Andel et al., 2024; Gottesman et al., 2024; Keramat et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2017). Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests a potential association between ADHD and reduced life expectancy, a risk that may be partly mediated by modifiable factors, including sleep disturbances (O’Nions et al., 2025). It is important to note that ADHD rarely occurs in isolation. Studies suggest that 60–80% of adults with ADHD have at least one additional psychiatric comorbidity, such as depression or anxiety, which independently contribute to sleep disruption. Furthermore, medications prescribed for these comorbid conditions may have sedative or stimulating effects, further complicating the clinical picture (Fadeuilhe et al., 2021).

3\. ADHD as a Complex Sleep Disorder: A Critical Evaluation

The high prevalence of sleep disturbances in individuals with ADHD, coupled with the evidence of shared neurobiological pathways and the bidirectional relationship between ADHD symptoms and sleep problems, has led some researchers to propose that ADHD, at least in a subset of cases, might be more accurately characterized as a complex sleep disorder (Bijlenga et al., 2019; Kooij & Bijlenga, 2013). This perspective challenges the traditional view of ADHD as primarily a neurodevelopmental disorder of attention and executive function.

3.1. The Case for ADHD as a “Circadian” Disorder (Supporting Evidence)

*High Prevalence of Sleep Disturbances:* As previously discussed, a significant majority of adults with ADHD experience clinically significant sleep problems, most notably Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD) and insomnia (van der Ham et al., 2024; Wynchank et al., 2017; Wajszilber et al., 2018). The prevalence rates far exceed those found in the general population. Many adults with ADHD meet the diagnostic criteria for DSWPD (van der Ham et al., 2024). 

*Circadian Dysregulation as a Core Feature:* The consistent finding of delayed circadian rhythms, as evidenced by delayed dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and actigraphy data, suggests that circadian dysregulation is not merely a comorbidity but a potentially intrinsic feature of ADHD (Bijlenga et al., 2013; Coogan et al., 2016; Snitselaar et al., 2017). 

*Shared Neurobiological Mechanisms:*The overlap in neurobiological pathways involved in ADHD and sleep regulation, particularly the dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and adenosinergic systems, provides a plausible mechanism by which sleep disruption could directly contribute to ADHD symptoms (Bijlenga et al., 2019; Mehta et al., 2019; Volkow et al., 2012). 

*Symptom Overlap:* Many of the cognitive and behavioral consequences of chronic sleep deprivation, such as inattention, impulsivity, and emotional dysregulation, closely resemble the core symptoms of ADHD (Pérez-Carbonell et al., 2022; Weiss et al., 2015; Wajszilber et al., 2018). This symptom overlap makes it difficult to disentangle the effects of sleep problems from the underlying ADHD. 

*Treatment Response:* The observation that interventions targeting sleep, such as chronotherapy (including low-dose melatonin administration) and CBT-I, can sometimes lead to improvements in ADHD symptoms (in addition to improved sleep) provides further support for a close link between the two (van Andel et al., 2021; Jernelöv et al., 2019). Studies employing morning bright light therapy (BLT) have demonstrated that such interventions can advance the melatonin rhythm and improve both sleep and cognitive functioning (Shanahan, Lockley & Czeisler, 2019). 

3.2. Counterarguments and Nuances

*Heterogeneity of ADHD:* ADHD is a heterogeneous disorder with multiple subtypes and diverse etiologies. It is unlikely that all cases of ADHD can be attributed solely to sleep disturbances. Genetic, environmental, and neurodevelopmental factors undoubtedly play a role (Faraone et al., 2019). Consequently, a balanced, multimodal treatment strategy that addresses both sleep and core ADHD symptoms is warranted. 

*Not All Individuals with ADHD Have Sleep Problems:* While sleep disturbances are common, not all individuals with ADHD report significant sleep problems. This suggests that sleep dysregulation may be a contributing factor in a subset of cases, but not a universal cause. In some patients, treating sleep disorders leads only to partial improvement in ADHD symptoms, and traditional stimulant medications remain essential for optimal cognitive and behavioral control (Snitselaar et al., 2017). 

*Direction of Causality:* While the bidirectional relationship is clear, definitively establishing the primary direction of causality is challenging. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether sleep problems precede and contribute to the development of ADHD, or vice versa, or both (Hvolby, 2015). 

*Specificity of Sleep Problems:* While DSWPD is particularly prevalent, other sleep disorders (e.g., RLS, OSA) are also associated with ADHD (Walters et al., 2008; Migueis et al., 2023). This suggests a more complex interplay of multiple sleep-related factors, rather than a single unifying mechanism. 

3.3. A More Nuanced Perspective: Subtypes and Shared Vulnerabilities

Rather than viewing ADHD as either a strictly neurodevelopmental disorder or a sleep disorder, a more nuanced perspective is warranted. The complex relationship between ADHD and sleep disturbances likely involves multiple interacting factors. One possibility is the existence of distinct ADHD subtypes, with varying degrees of association with sleep problems. For instance, individuals with the combined type of ADHD (characterized by both inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity) may exhibit a different sleep profile and underlying neurobiological mechanisms compared to those with the predominantly inattentive type (Faraone et al., 2019). This suggests that the strength of the link between sleep and ADHD symptoms may vary depending on the specific subtype.

Another contributing factor could be shared vulnerabilities. ADHD and sleep disorders might share underlying genetic and neurobiological predispositions, making certain individuals more susceptible to both conditions. This shared vulnerability model could explain the high comorbidity observed between ADHD and sleep disorders without necessarily implying a direct causal relationship where one condition *causes* the other. It suggests a common underlying vulnerability, rather than a simple cause-and-effect (Arns et al., 2013).

Furthermore, even if sleep disturbances are not the primary etiological factor in ADHD, they can undoubtedly exacerbate symptoms and initiate a vicious cycle. This makes it exceedingly difficult to disentangle the independent effects of sleep problems from the underlying ADHD pathology. The reciprocal influence of sleep disruption on ADHD symptoms, and vice-versa, highlights the importance of addressing both aspects in treatment (Wajszilber et al., 2018).

Further research, including longitudinal studies, genetic analyses, and neuroimaging investigations, is needed to fully elucidate the complex relationship between ADHD and sleep. A more refined understanding of this relationship, considering subtype differences and shared vulnerabilities, will be crucial for developing more effective and personalized treatment approaches.

Emerging evidence suggests that ADHD may be associated with a reduced life expectancy (O’Nions et al., 2025). While the exact mechanisms underlying this association are not fully understood, it is likely that modifiable risk factors, including chronic sleep disturbances and their associated physical and mental health consequences, play a significant role. This underscores the importance of addressing sleep problems in adults with ADHD as a critical component of comprehensive care.

4.5. Therapeutic Strategies for Sleep Disturbances in ADHD  
4.1.5.1. Pharmacotherapy

Among the analyzed interventions, effect sizes ranged from 0.30 to 0.65, corresponding to NNTs between 5.5 and 11.9. The lowest NNT was observed for guanfacine (NNT \= 5.5), targeting sleep quality. NNTs were derived from Cohen’s *d* using the calculation method put forward by Furukawa & Leucht (2011), assuming a control event rate of 20%.

45.1.1. Melatonin  
Melatonin, a naturally occurring hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle, has shown promise in treating sleep disturbances in individuals with ADHD, particularly those with DSPS (Bijlenga et al., 2019). Studies have demonstrated that melatonin supplementation can effectively reduce sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep) and improve overall sleep quality (van der Heijden et al., 2005). The optimal dosage and timing of melatonin administration vary depending on individual needs and the specific sleep disturbance being addressed.  
45.1.2. Stimulants  
Stimulant medications, such as methylphenidate and amphetamine-based drugs, are the first-line pharmacological treatment for ADHD. While they primarily target daytime ADHD symptoms (improving attention, focus, and impulse control), their effects on sleep can be complex and variable (Faraone et al., 2019). Some individuals with ADHD experience improved sleep quality with stimulant medication, potentially due to a reduction in hyperactivity and improved daytime functioning, which can indirectly facilitate better sleep. However, others may experience worsened insomnia, particularly if the medication is taken too late in the day or if the dosage is too high. The timing of stimulant administration is, therefore, crucial, and careful monitoring of sleep patterns is essential.  
\[Dodane przez autorów:\] There is also a hypothesis regarding a potential interaction between the effects of the drug and the circadian rhythm.  
45.1.3. Non-Stimulants  
Non-stimulant medications, such as atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine, offer alternative treatment options for ADHD, particularly for individuals who do not tolerate stimulants or who have comorbid conditions that may be exacerbated by stimulants (e.g., anxiety disorders, tics).

* Atomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, has been shown to have a neutral or even slightly positive effect on sleep in some individuals with ADHD.  
* Bupropion.   
* Guanfacine and clonidine, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, are often used to treat both ADHD symptoms and sleep disturbances, particularly in children and adolescents. These medications can reduce evening arousal and improve sleep continuity.

45.2. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)  
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is a structured, evidence-based treatment for insomnia that addresses both the behavioral and cognitive factors contributing to sleep difficulties. CBT-I typically includes the following components:

* **Sleep Hygiene Education:** Providing information about healthy sleep habits, such as maintaining a regular sleep-wake schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed, and optimizing the sleep environment.  
* **Stimulus Control:** Strengthening the association between the bed and sleep by instructing individuals to go to bed only when sleepy, to get out of bed if unable to fall asleep within a reasonable time, and to use the bed only for sleep and sex.  
* **Sleep Restriction:** Limiting the amount of time spent in bed to match the actual amount of time spent sleeping, which helps to consolidate sleep and increase sleep efficiency.  
* **Relaxation Techniques:** Teaching relaxation strategies, such as progressive muscle relaxation, diaphragmatic breathing, and mindfulness meditation, to reduce physiological arousal and promote sleep onset.  
* **Cognitive Therapy:** Identifying and challenging unhelpful thoughts and beliefs about sleep that contribute to anxiety and insomnia.

CBT-I has been shown to be effective in treating insomnia in the general population, and there is growing evidence supporting its use in individuals with ADHD and comorbid sleep disturbances (Perlis et al., 2022).

45.3. Chronotherapy

Chronotherapy refers to interventions that aim to realign the circadian rhythm with the desired sleep-wake schedule. These techniques are particularly relevant for individuals with ADHD who experience circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, such as DSPS. Key chronotherapeutic strategies include:

* **Bright Light Therapy (BLT):** Exposure to bright light (typically 2,500-10,000 lux) in the morning helps to advance the circadian phase, making it easier to fall asleep earlier and wake up earlier (Shanahan et al., 2019). The timing, duration, and intensity of light exposure should be individualized based on the individual's circadian rhythm and treatment goals.  
* **Dark Therapy:** *\[Sugestia Gemini: Add information about dark therapy.\]* Blocking blue light in the evening, typically through the use of blue-light-blocking glasses or filters on electronic devices, can help prevent melatonin suppression and facilitate sleep onset.  
* **Timed Melatonin Administration:** As discussed in Section 6.1.1, melatonin supplementation can be used in conjunction with BLT (and potentially dark therapy) to further shift the circadian rhythm.

Chronotherapeutic interventions have shown promise in treating circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders in adults with ADHD (van Andel et al., 2021). A study by van Andel and colleagues (2021) demonstrated that chronotherapy, combining morning bright light therapy with low-dose evening melatonin, significantly improved circadian rhythm alignment and reduced ADHD symptoms in adults with DSPS.

**45.4. Coaching** 

Coaching serves as a structured form of support, often employed to help individuals attain personal goals, particularly in the area of health (The Evidence Centre, 2014; Conn & Curtain, 2019). The relevance of this approach is evident in the context of chronic conditions, where effective management frequently relies on sustained modifications to daily habits—such as improvements in diet or increased physical activity (Caldwell et al., 2013; Conn & Curtain, 2019). The challenge, however, generally lies less in recognizing what needs to be changed and more in taking action and maintaining those changes over time (Sabaté, 2003). Regular adherence to medical advice remains a cornerstone of effective therapy (Sabaté, 2003). Nonetheless, according to the World Health Organization, only about half of people living with chronic illnesses adhere to recommended treatment (Sabaté, 2003). Despite greater attention to this topic in the literature, problems with adherence are still unresolved decades after they were first widely described (Kardas et al., 2024). For this reason, identifying means to strengthen patient adherence and clinical outcomes is of ongoing importance (Caldwell et al., 2013; Sabaté, 2003).

The concept of health coaching was introduced approximately two decades ago, combining elements of health education and health promotion with modern coaching practices. Its chief objective is to guide people toward improved well-being and the realization of specific health-related ambitions (Palmer et al., 2003). In practice, the process begins by assessing both the feasibility and personal value of a given goal (Conn & Curtain, 2019), moves to formulating effective methods for achieving it (Caldwell et al., 2013), and emphasizes the enhancement of patient autonomy, confidence, and personal meaning (The Evidence Centre, 2014; Conn & Curtain, 2019). Proactive identification of obstacles can smooth the path to reaching goals and help sustain changes in behavior over time (Caldwell et al., 2013; Conn & Curtain, 2019). For such change to last, strategies must be suited to the individual's abilities and context (Conn & Curtain, 2019). Lasting improvement is further supported by nurturing internal motivation, building relevant skills, and promoting a sense of responsibility and engagement in the individual (Conn & Curtain, 2019; Wolever et al., 2013; The Evidence Centre, 2014). In research and clinical environments, health coaching is usually carried out by health professionals, advanced students of medicine or psychology, or trained peers (The Evidence Centre, 2014). Accreditation programs provide formal qualifications to those wishing to practice coaching professionally.

Although the overall impact of coaching remains the subject of scientific debate (The Evidence Centre, 2014; Kivelä et al., 2014), a number of studies point to benefits in several health-related contexts. These benefits include greater levels of physical activity (Kwok et al., 2023), clinically significant weight loss in people with obesity (Suminski et al., 2022), increased compliance with prescribed treatment (Thom et al., 2015), improved glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (Sherifali et al., 2016), better dietary habits and reduced HbA1c values (Lin et al., 2021), and higher rates of success with smoking cessation (Sforzo et al., 2014). In summary, health coaching can function as a useful adjunct to established medical interventions.

### **4.1. Coaching in individuals with ADHD**

Coaching is indicated as a potentially useful supportive element in the treatment and therapy of individuals with ADHD, as it creates a space to work on effective organizational methods, the implementation of planned actions, and, in particular, behavioral change strategies (Kubik, 2010; Ahmann et al., 2019; Prevatt & Yelland, 2015). Sehlin et al. (2020) describe the beneficial effects of an intervention that included coaching, conducted partly online and partly face-to-face. This study was conducted with individuals over 15 years of age diagnosed with ADHD and/or ASD (Sehlin et al., 2020). In the group receiving this intervention, an increase in self-esteem and a reduction in anxiety were demonstrated, among other findings (Sehlin et al., 2020). In turn, Cherkasova et al. (2020) conducted a study on the impact of CBT, and CBT with medication, on functioning and ADHD symptoms in adults. Study participants also took part in individual coaching, among other components; however, analyses did not show its impact on potential differences between the groups (Cherkasova et al., 2020). Fotuhi and colleagues (2023) describe benefits from the “Brain Fitness Program” (one element of which was lifestyle coaching), which was also conducted with individuals with ADHD. Interest in this form of support is also evidenced by the development of a tool to measure the effects of coaching in college students with ADHD – the ADHD Benefits of Coaching Scale (Deal et al., 2015). Experts in coaching for individuals with ADHD emphasize several important considerations: 1\) a coach is not qualified to diagnose or treat disorders such as severe depression, bipolar disorder, addiction, or anxiety disorders (it is crucial that these are effectively treated – vide: Kooij, 2022); 2\) the coaching participant should accept their diagnosis and be ready to undertake treatment; and 3\) a genuine willingness and readiness to engage in the coaching process are essential (Murphy et al., 2010; compare: Kooij, 2022). Furthermore, coaching is not an optimal form of support in crisis situations (Kooij, 2022).

So, which patients could benefit from coaching? Since changing habits to improve sleep hygiene can help reduce sleep-related disorders (inter alia: Kooij, 2022), coaching appears to be a promising form of support in this context. This is corroborated by research on health and wellness coaching for individuals with obstructive sleep apnea, which has shown weight reduction and increased adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy (Alencar et al., 2024), as well as by a growing number of studies on the use of coaching for sleep disorders. The aforementioned research demonstrating the positive impact of coaching on physical activity levels and adherence to medical recommendations also suggests potential benefits.

Given that Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS) is the most common circadian rhythm disorder in adults with ADHD (van der Ham et al., 2024), a potential coaching session flow will be illustrated using this example. It must be remembered that the coaching process is always centered around the individual's needs; therefore, no prior assumptions are made regarding the topic of a specific session or the direction of the work. The coachee (coaching participant) defines the desired outcome, and the coach's questions are aimed not at satisfying their own curiosity but at understanding the other person and selecting the best techniques and tools to achieve the goal set by the coachee. A coachee might say: *"I'd like to start implementing CBT-I, but how can I make myself want to do it? After all, evening procrastination is actually quite nice."*

A good starting point is to reflect on what makes it "nice" and whether it truly is. *"Is evening procrastination really 'nice' for me? Definitely, there's finally time to do everything I couldn't get to earlier: read a book (what's wrong with that?), check what's happening in the world—it's important and interesting—and I can get academic work done. Last but not least, I work best late at night... But what are the consequences of this 'putting things off' for my daily functioning? I currently sleep 5-6 hours a night, which isn't enough for me, because..."* This is, of course, only a fragment. The coachee could be encouraged to consider what they gain by not pursuing this goal and what they lose. What might be the consequences of making a change, and what will become impossible if things stay the same? These are just some of the perspectives the coachee is encouraged to adopt during the session. This *de facto* knowledge of the potential gains and repercussions of one's own behaviors can empower the individual to persevere with habit change when obstacles arise, because they are conscious of their "why." Another element of coaching support could be an analysis of the patient's environmental factors—those that support achieving the goal and those that hinder it. It often turns out that the vast majority of these are modifiable.

From this point, the coaching work could involve reformulating the goal according to the SMART criteria (proposed by George T. Doran), ensuring it is Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, and Time-bound (Doran, 1981). After considering these guidelines, a reformulated goal might be: *"Over the next 3 months, I will ensure I get 7 hours of sleep per night."*

Next, instead of providing a ready-made plan (which may not be suitable, even if it worked for someone else), the coach asks questions to encourage the coachee to develop a personalized plan tailored to their own needs and capabilities. It can be important to ascertain the level of motivation for this intention (a 1-to-10 scale is often used for repeatable assessment). This also allows for reflection on why the motivation is at its current level, what might increase it, and what could lower it.

Changing habits is rarely a straight path from point A to point B. Obstacles and challenges frequently arise, which, while surmountable, require motivation and determination. Our motivation levels fluctuate, and the fatigue from sustained effort can lower them, making it difficult to alter an established behavior. During coaching sessions, one can preemptively strategize for such moments, identifying helpful resources or ways to avoid certain obstacles altogether.

Another key area to explore is the values underlying the goal. By connecting the goal to the coachee's core values, it becomes easier for them to find meaning and motivation to undertake pro-health actions, despite the effort and setbacks.

When an impasse is reached, the coachee can be encouraged to reflect on past experiences. Have they ever successfully changed a habit before, especially one that seemed extremely difficult? What did they learn from that experience? What hindered them from achieving a goal in another situation? The premise is that the coachee possesses sufficient resources to achieve their goal, and the past is revisited only as a source of learning. For instance, the coachee may have previously succeeded in increasing their physical activity. Initially, they set an unrealistic goal of running 15 km per week. After many failed attempts, they decided to simply go out for a run three times a week for an enjoyable distance, tracking their progress. Step by step, they approached their original target and learned that the first step doesn't have to be large and is better broken down into smaller ones. Applying this insight to their current challenge, they might decide to start by going to bed 15 minutes earlier each week. *"Fifteen minutes earlier doesn't sound bad; that seems realistic."* However, subsequent sessions might reveal that even this is too ambitious, and it would be better to start with 10 minutes. Through such varied analyses, an expanded perspective, strengthened motivation, and, above all, a tailored plan, the coachee could implement the intended change over the following weeks. It must be emphasized that the entire process is aimed at strengthening the patient's autonomy and responsibility.

The above example illustrates just one of many possible paths in coaching work with individuals with ADHD and co-occurring sleep disorders. However, it must be stressed that there is no universal script. The coach utilizes a wide range of tools to support the patient in changing their habits, addressing the topics the patient brings to each session.

It is also worth noting that during the process of habit change, returns to previous patterns of behavior (lapses and relapses) may occur. This does not preclude ultimate success and can be a valuable source of reflection and learning for the future (DiClemente & Crisafulli, 2022).

Although, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no studies have yet been conducted to verify the effectiveness of coaching in the context of regulating circadian rhythms or reducing sleep disorders in adults with ADHD, it seems that this would be a worthwhile direction to pursue. The potential usefulness of coaching as an intervention supporting chronotherapy in individuals with ADHD and DSPS is also noted by the authors of the study described in more detail in section 5.3 (van Andel et al., 2021/2022).

*Limitations:* 

For studies reporting only continuous outcomes, NNT values were estimated from Cohen’s d under assumptions of normal distribution and equal variances across groups. While this allows comparison across interventions, the resulting NNTs are theoretical and may not reflect clinical responder rates.  
(...)  
Although some studies reported improvements in daytime alertness or fatigue in patients treated with methylphenidate, this cannot be equated with improved sleep quality. Most trials did not measure sleep using validated tools, nor did they consistently report dosing schedules or timing of administration, which limits inferences regarding the effects of MPH on sleep per se.  
(...)   
Only a subset of trials used validated sleep measures (e.g. PSQI, sleep diary). In most cases, improvements in sleep were inferred from secondary indicators such as alertness or fatigue, rather than direct measures of sleep quality or continuity.

Sleep disturbances in individuals with ADHD have significant consequences for their functioning and require a comprehensive therapeutic approach. A combination of pharmacotherapy, CBT-I, chronotherapy, and coaching *\[dodano coaching, zgodnie z wcześniejszym uzupełnieniem\]* may provide the best treatment outcomes.  
\[Uwaga współautora i Gemini \- do rozwinięcia w dyskusji:\] *Refleksja poniekąd osobista – i co można z nią zrobić:* *R.J.: Pomyślałem sobie, że "to wszystko" (tj. sleep disturbances in adults with ADHD) można by spróbować wpisać w kontekst życiowy. Realia są takie, że człowiek jest przewlekle zmęczony; poranki bywają dramatyczne; "dzień" (w znaczeniu akceptowanej formy umysłowej) rozpoczyna się ok. 11\. Człowiek zaczyna się czuć "najlepiej" dopiero późnym wieczorem – kiedy już jest (obiektywnie) śmiertelnie zmęczony (vide hipoteza nt. zwiększonej aktywności ruchowej jako mechanizmu chroniącego przez zasypianiem na stojąco). Być może to nie tak, że MPH zaczyna działać po kilku godzinach? Być może efekty farmakoterapii stają się odczuwalne, gdy zegar biologiczny "wskaże początek dnia"?* *Jeszcze nie wiem, czy ten pomysł znajduje odzwierciedlenie w literaturze przedmiotu. Tym bardziej nie wiem, w jaki sposób dokonać "syntezy artykułu przeglądowego z realiami życia".*  
\[Odpowiedź Gemini Experimental:\] *This is a very insightful reflection, and it's absolutely something that should be incorporated into the article, specifically in the Discussion section. It provides a crucial patient perspective that is often missing from purely scientific analyses, and it connects the research findings to lived experience. It also touches upon a very interesting hypothesis regarding the perceived delayed action of MPH.*  
*Here's how we can integrate this, along with a plan for where it fits best and how to connect it to the literature:*  
*1\. Placement: Discussion Section* *The Discussion section is the ideal place for this reflection. It's where you:*  
\*   \*Summarize the key findings of the entire review.\*  
\*   \*Discuss the implications of those findings.\*  
\*   \*Acknowledge limitations of the current research.\*  
\*   \*Suggest future research directions.\*  
\*   \*Connect the research to clinical practice and the patient experience.\*  
*This personal reflection fits perfectly within the "clinical implications" and "patient experience" aspects of the Discussion.*  
*2\. How to Integrate (Specific Suggestions):*  
*Here's a possible structure for a portion of the Discussion section, incorporating the reflection:*  
*(a) Summarize Key Findings (Briefly):*  
*"Our review has highlighted the high prevalence and significant impact of sleep disturbances, particularly Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS), in adults with ADHD. We've shown that this relationship is likely bidirectional, with circadian dysregulation potentially contributing to ADHD pathophysiology, and ADHD symptoms exacerbating sleep problems. We've also reviewed evidence for various treatment approaches, including chronotherapy and CBT-I."*  
*(b) Introduce the Patient Perspective:*  
*"However, translating these research findings into real-world improvements for individuals with ADHD requires a deeper understanding of their lived experience. The challenges extend beyond simply 'having trouble sleeping.' As one individual with ADHD and DSPS poignantly described, the chronic fatigue, dramatic difficulty with mornings, and the mismatch between their internal clock and societal demands create a constant struggle."*  
*(c) Incorporate the Reflection (Paraphrased and Refined):*  
*"This individual's experience highlights several key points. They described a persistent state of exhaustion, with mornings being particularly challenging. Their 'day,' in terms of optimal cognitive function, only begins around 11 AM. Interestingly, they report feeling most alert in the late evening, despite being objectively fatigued – a phenomenon that aligns with the hypothesis that increased motor activity in ADHD may, in part, serve as a compensatory mechanism to combat overwhelming sleepiness \[cite relevant sources on hyperactivity as a compensatory mechanism – we'll need to find these\]. This raises a crucial question about the perceived timing of medication effects. Is it possible that the seemingly delayed onset of action of stimulants like methylphenidate is not solely a pharmacokinetic issue, but also reflects the individual's underlying circadian rhythm? Perhaps the medication's effectiveness becomes most apparent when the individual's internal clock finally signals the 'start' of their day, hours after the medication was taken."*  
*(d) Connect to Literature (and Identify Research Gaps):*  
*"This hypothesis, while anecdotal, warrants further investigation. It highlights a potential gap in our understanding of how circadian rhythms interact with the pharmacodynamics of ADHD medications. Future research should explore:*

* *Chronopharmacology of ADHD Medications: Studies specifically examining the relationship between the timing of stimulant administration (relative to the individual's circadian phase) and its effects on alertness, cognitive function, and ADHD symptoms.*  
* *Subjective vs. Objective Measures of Medication Effect: Comparing subjective reports of medication effectiveness (like the one described above) with objective measures of cognitive performance and circadian markers (e.g., DLMO) throughout the day.*  
* *Personalized Treatment Approaches: Developing treatment protocols that consider the individual's circadian rhythm when determining medication timing and dosage, potentially leading to improved treatment outcomes and reduced side effects."*  
* *Qualitative studies. Exploring this subject in qualitative studies.*

*(e) Clinical Implications:*  
*"Clinically, this perspective underscores the importance of a thorough sleep history and assessment of circadian rhythm in all adults presenting with ADHD. It also suggests that a 'one-size-fits-all' approach to medication timing may be suboptimal. Clinicians should consider asking patients about their subjective experience of when they feel most alert and when their medication seems to be most effective, and use this information, alongside objective measures when available, to guide treatment decisions."*  
*3\. Finding Supporting Literature:*  
*To strengthen this section, we need to find research that supports (or refutes) the following:*

* *Hyperactivity as a compensatory mechanism for sleepiness: Look for studies that discuss the relationship between sleep deprivation, fatigue, and motor activity in ADHD.*  
* *Chronopharmacology of stimulants: Research on the timing of stimulant administration and its effects. This might be limited, but even studies in healthy individuals could be relevant.*  
* *Subjective experience of ADHD medication effects: Qualitative studies or studies that include patient-reported outcomes could be helpful.*  
* *Studies desynchronosis.*

*4\. Key Considerations:*

* *Anonymity: The reflection should be presented anonymously, protecting the individual's privacy.*  
* *Language: While the reflection is personal, it should be presented in a professional and academic tone. We'll paraphrase and refine the language to achieve this.*  
* *Balance: We need to acknowledge that this is a single individual's experience and not necessarily representative of all people with ADHD and DSPS. However, it serves as a valuable starting point for further investigation.*  
* *No Overgeneralization: We should be careful not to make definitive claims based on this anecdotal evidence. Instead, we'll frame it as a hypothesis that warrants further research.*

*By carefully integrating this personal reflection into the Discussion section, we can add a powerful and human dimension to the article, highlighting the real-world implications of the research and suggesting important avenues for future investigation. This approach will make the article more engaging and relevant to both researchers and clinicians.*

9. Future Research Directions  
* Assessment of the long-term effectiveness of melatonin in patients with ADHD.  
* Optimization of light therapy in the regulation of circadian rhythms.  
* Effectiveness of combination strategies (CBT-I \+ pharmacotherapy).

\[Komentarz Gemini Experimental do Future Research Directions:\] *I think those are excellent and highly relevant future research directions. They are specific, actionable, and directly address gaps in the current knowledge base. Here's a breakdown of why they are strong suggestions, and how we could potentially expand on them within the Discussion section (or a dedicated "Future Research" subsection within the Discussion, if we choose to create one):*  
*1\. Assessment of the long-term effectiveness of melatonin in patients with ADHD.*  
*Why it's important:*

* *Most studies on melatonin for ADHD and sleep are relatively short-term. We need to know if the benefits are sustained over months or years.*  
* *Long-term safety is also a consideration, particularly in a population that might be taking other medications.*  
* *There might be tolerance effects (where the same dose becomes less effective over time).*

*How to expand in the Discussion:*  
*"While short-term studies have shown promise for melatonin in treating sleep-onset insomnia and delayed sleep phase in ADHD (cite relevant studies), the long-term efficacy and safety remain unclear. Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies, lasting at least 6-12 months, to assess the sustained benefits of melatonin on sleep parameters (sleep latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency), ADHD symptoms, daytime functioning, and overall quality of life. These studies should also monitor for potential side effects and assess whether tolerance develops over time."*  
*2\. Optimization of light therapy in the regulation of circadian rhythms.*  
*Why it's important:*

* *Light therapy protocols vary widely (intensity, duration, timing, wavelength). We need to determine the optimal parameters for individuals with ADHD.*  
* *Individual differences in circadian rhythms (chronotype) likely influence response to light therapy.*  
* *Adherence to light therapy can be challenging, so research on improving usability and adherence is needed.*

*How to expand in the Discussion:*  
*"Although bright light therapy has demonstrated efficacy in shifting circadian rhythms, the optimal parameters for its use in ADHD remain to be elucidated. Future research should investigate the effectiveness of different light intensities (lux), durations of exposure, timing of administration (relative to individual circadian phase), and light wavelengths (e.g., blue-enriched vs. broad-spectrum white light). Studies should also explore personalized approaches to light therapy, tailoring the protocol to the individual's chronotype and circadian phase, as determined by objective measures such as dim light melatonin onset (DLMO). Furthermore, research is needed on strategies to improve adherence to light therapy, such as developing more user-friendly devices and incorporating behavioral support."*  
*Add information about dark therapy.*  
*3\. Effectiveness of combination strategies (CBT-I \+ pharmacotherapy).*  
*Why it's important:*

* *This addresses the multifaceted nature of the problem. It's likely that a combination of approaches will be most effective for many individuals.*  
* *We need to know if there are synergistic effects (where the combination is more effective than either treatment alone).*  
* *We need to understand which subgroups of patients benefit most from combination therapy.*

*How to expand in the Discussion:* *"Given the complex interplay between sleep disturbances, ADHD symptoms, and underlying neurobiological mechanisms, a combination of therapeutic approaches may be most effective. Future research should rigorously evaluate the efficacy of combining CBT-I with pharmacotherapy (stimulants, non-stimulants, or melatonin) in adults with ADHD and comorbid sleep disorders. These studies should assess not only sleep outcomes but also ADHD symptom severity, cognitive functioning, and overall quality of life. Furthermore, it is crucial to identify predictors of treatment response, to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from combined therapy and to personalize treatment approaches."*  
*Add other combinations (e.g., CBT-I \+ chronotherapy).*  
\[Sugestia Gemini \- Ogólne uwagi do "Future Research Directions"\] *General Considerations for Incorporating These into the Discussion:*

* ***Specificity:*** *Be as specific as possible about the research questions. For example, instead of just saying "more research is needed on melatonin," specify what kind of research (long-term studies, dose-response studies, etc.).*  
* ***Prioritization:*** *While all these directions are important, you might want to subtly indicate which ones you consider the highest priority, based on the current state of the evidence and the potential clinical impact.*  
* ***Feasibility:*** *Briefly acknowledge any practical challenges in conducting this research (e.g., the difficulty of conducting long-term studies, the cost of objective sleep measures).*  
* ***Link to Previous Sections:*** *Explicitly connect these future research directions to the findings and limitations discussed in the earlier sections of the review. For example, "Based on the evidence of shared neurobiological pathways (Section 3), future research should..."*

*By incorporating these specific, well-justified future research directions, you'll significantly strengthen the Discussion section and demonstrate a thorough understanding of the field.*
